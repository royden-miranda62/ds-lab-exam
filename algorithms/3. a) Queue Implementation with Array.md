# Question
Write a program to simulate the working of a queue of integers using an array.  
Provide the following operations: Insert, Delete, Display.  
The program should print appropriate messages for queue empty and queue overflow conditions.


# Declarations
`#include <stdio.h>`  
`#include <stdbool.h>`

`#define SIZE 5` : sets the maximum size of the queue.

`int queue[SIZE];` : declares an integer array as a queue.  
`int front = -1, rear = -1;` : initializes the front and rear pointers of the queue to -1.

> [!info] Note  
> A queue is full when the rear pointer is one less than the size (`rear = SIZE - 1`).  
> A queue is empty when the front pointer is -1.


# Functions
## 1. `void enqueue(item)`
### Algorithm
- Step 1: Check if the queue is full.
	- if so, print an "overflow" statement and return control.
	- else, continue with the function.
- Step 2: If the queue is empty (if `front` is -1), initialize the front pointer to 0.
- Step 3: increment the rear pointer by 1.
- Step 4: Assign `item` as the new rear element.
- Step 5: Print an "inserted" statement.
### Code

``` c
void enqueue(int item)
{
    if (isFull())
    {
        printf("Queue overflow. Cannot insert %d.\n", item);
        return;
    }

    if (front == -1)
        front = 0; // initialize the front index for first element

    queue[++rear] = item;
    printf("Inserted %d at the rear.\n", item);
}
```

## 2. `void dequeue()`
### Algorithm
- Step 1: Check if the queue is empty.
	- if so, print an "underflow" statement, reset the front and rear pointers to -1, and return control.
	- else, continue with the function.
- Step 2: Print the element at the front with a "deleted" statement.
	- alternatively, assign it to a variable and then print it with a "deleted" statement.
- Step 3: Increment the front pointer by 1.
### Code

``` c
void dequeue()
{
    if (isEmpty())
    {
        printf("Queue underflow. Cannot delete.\n");
        front = rear = -1;
        return;
    }

    int deleted = queue[front++];
    printf("Deleted %d from the front.\n", deleted);
}
```

## 3. `void display()`
### Algorithm
- Step 1: Check if the queue is empty.
	- if so, print an "empty" statement and return control.
	- else, continue with the program.
- Step 2: Loop through the queue from the front to the rear.
	- print all the elements one by one.
### Code
``` c
void display()
{
    if (isEmpty())
    {
        printf("\nQueue is empty.\n");
        return;
    }

    printf("\nQueue items (front to back): \n");
    printf("|");
    for (int i = front; i <= rear; i++)
        printf(" %d |", queue[i]);
    printf("\n\n");
}
```


# Complete Program
``` c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

#define SIZE 5

int queue[SIZE];
int front = -1, rear = -1; // initializing the front and rear pointers

// check if queue is full
bool isFull()
{
    return (rear == SIZE - 1);
}

// check if queue is empty
bool isEmpty()
{
    return (front == -1 || front > rear);
}

// insert an element at the rear of the queue
void enqueue(int item)
{
    if (isFull())
    {
        printf("Queue overflow. Cannot insert %d.\n", item);
        return;
    }

    if (front == -1) // if queue is empty
        front = 0; // initialize the front pointer for first element

    queue[++rear] = item;
    printf("Inserted %d at the rear.\n", item);
}

// delete an element from the front of the queue
void dequeue()
{
    if (isEmpty())
    {
        printf("Queue underflow. Cannot delete.\n");
        front = rear = -1;
        return;
    }

    int deleted = queue[front++];
    printf("Deleted %d from the front.\n", deleted);
}

// display all the elements in the queue
void display()
{
    if (isEmpty())
    {
        printf("\nQueue is empty.\n");
        return;
    }

    printf("\nQueue items (front to back): \n");
    printf("|");
    for (int i = front; i <= rear; i++)
        printf(" %d |", queue[i]);
    printf("\n\n");
}

int main()
{
    printf("----- Queue Operations -----\n");
    printf("Size of queue = %d\n", SIZE);

    printf("\n--- Enqueue ---\n");
    enqueue(1);
    enqueue(2);
    enqueue(3);
    enqueue(4);
    enqueue(5);
    enqueue(6);

    display();

    printf("\n--- Dequeue ---\n");
    dequeue();
    dequeue();
    dequeue();

    display();

    dequeue();
    dequeue();
    dequeue();

    display();
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Output
```
----- Queue Operations -----
Size of queue = 5

--- Enqueue ---
Inserted 1 at the rear.
Inserted 2 at the rear.
Inserted 3 at the rear.
Inserted 4 at the rear.
Inserted 5 at the rear.
Queue overflow. Cannot insert 6.

Queue items (front to back):
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |


--- Dequeue ---
Deleted 1 from the front.
Deleted 2 from the front.
Deleted 3 from the front.

Queue items (front to back):
| 4 | 5 |

Deleted 4 from the front.
Deleted 5 from the front.
Queue underflow. Cannot delete.

Queue is empty.
